# QR Code Generator - Architecture Overview

## Design Principles Applied

This refactored codebase follows several key software engineering principles:

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Business Logic**: Isolated in services (`QRCodeService`)
- **State Management**: Extracted into custom hooks
- **UI Components**: Small, focused, single-responsibility components
- **Utilities**: Pure functions for data formatting and manipulation

### 2. **Single Responsibility Principle**

Each component/hook/service has one clear responsibility:

- `QRCodeService`: QR code generation with fallback strategies
- `useFormData`: Form state management
- `useQRCodeGenerator`: QR generation orchestration
- `useClipboard`: Clipboard operations
- Individual form components: Handle specific input types

### 3. **Low Coupling & High Cohesion**

- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Dependencies flow downward (hooks → services)
- No tight coupling between UI and business logic

### 4. **Inversion of Control**

- Custom hooks manage state and side effects
- Components receive data and callbacks as props
- Service layer is injectable and testable

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Service Layer Pattern**

- `QRCodeService` implements the Singleton pattern
- Encapsulates QR generation complexity
- Provides multiple fallback strategies
- Easily testable and mockable

### 2. **Custom Hook Pattern**

- Encapsulates stateful logic and side effects
- Provides clean API for components
- Promotes reusability across components
- Separates concerns between state and presentation

### 3. **Strategy Pattern**

- QR generation with multiple fallback strategies
- Form rendering based on active tab type
- Graceful degradation for external dependencies

### 4. **Composition Pattern**

- Small, focused components composed into larger ones
- Each component handles one specific UI concern
- Props-down, events-up communication

## Benefits of This Architecture

### **Maintainability**

- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Clear boundaries between different concerns
- Minimal impact when making changes

### **Testability**

- Pure functions are easily unit tested
- Services can be mocked in component tests
- Custom hooks can be tested in isolation

### **Reusability**

- Form components can be reused in other contexts
- Custom hooks can be shared across components
- Service layer can be used in different parts of the app

### **Scalability**

- Easy to add new QR code types or form fields
- New generation strategies can be added to the service
- Components can be extended without affecting others

### **Type Safety**

- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Compile-time error detection
- Better IDE support and auto-completion

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: QRious library loaded on-demand
- **Memoization**: Potential for React.memo on pure components
- **Debouncing**: Can be easily added to form inputs
- **Code Splitting**: Service layer can be dynamically imported

## Testing Strategy

With this architecture, you can easily test:

- **Unit Tests**: Pure functions in `utils/`
- **Hook Tests**: Custom hooks with React Testing Library
- **Component Tests**: UI components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Service layer with mock dependencies
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflows

## Future Enhancements

This architecture supports easy addition of:

- New QR code formats (WiFi, SMS, etc.)
- Batch QR code generation
- QR code history/favorites
- Export to different formats
- Offline capabilities
- Analytics and tracking
